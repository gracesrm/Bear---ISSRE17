Suite are not open-source software or available for free of
charge.

- The Phoronix Test Suite contains tests which may stress your
system and in some cases could exhibit stability problems of the
system's hardware or software configuration. The Phoronix Test
Suite is provided WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. In no event shall
OpenBenchmarking.org, Phoronix Media, the Phoronix Test Suite, or
any associated stakeholder be liable to any party for any direct

- If you opt to submit your test results to OpenBenchmarking.org,
the final results as well as basic hardware and software details
(what is shown in the results viewer) will be shared and publicly
accessible through http://www.openbenchmarking.org/.

- Public bug reports, feature requests, and other issues can be
brought up in the Phoronix Test Suite forums, mailing list, or a

Anonymous Usage Reporting / Statistics: If enabling the anonymous
usage reporting / statistics feature, some information about the
Phoronix Test Suite runs will be submitted to
OpenBenchmarking.org. This information is used for analytical
purposes, including but not limited to, determining the most
popular tests / suites and calculating average run-times for
different test profiles. The test results are not reported in
this process nor the installed software / hardware information,
but ambient information about the testing process. This
information is stored anonymously. More information on this
feature is available with the included documentation.

Anonymous Software / Hardware Reporting: If enabling the
anonymous hardware / software reporting, general information on
your installed hardware / software components will be reported to
OpenBenchmarking.org. Hardware information is general details
such as, but not limited to, the installed CPU, motherboard, and
other general components. Software information is general and
contains details such as your operating system, graphics
processor driver, kernel, and software architecture. No personal
information is collected. This information is pooled along with
the submissions from all other users to show general trends and
other details on OpenBenchmarking.org.
